# Statistical Techniques in Robotics

The goal of this repository is to display the work completed during 16-831, Statistical Techniques in Robotics.  

I will attepmt to complete all of the assignments using python instead of MATLAB due to its significantly less useful functionality in industry.  

## Weighted Majority Algorithms
The first assignment was to program a weigted majority algorithm (WMA) and a randomized weighted majority algorithm (RWMA) and show the differences.  

## Multi-Armed Bandits
The second assignment looks at algorithms like Generalized Weighted Majority (GWM), EXP3, and UCB on different games.
